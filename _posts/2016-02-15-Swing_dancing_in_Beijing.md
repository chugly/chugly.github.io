###if it ain't got that swing!

My sister and I grew up taking dance classes at Mary Linick Dance Studio in Miami, Florida. It seemed like there was always a rotation of a cousin or best friend through one of our tap, jazz, or ballet classes, but we were the regulars. I think Amber still remembers the footwork from her 4th grade tap routine to Grease Lightning. My favorite dance recital costume was when I dressed up as a white duck, complete with a orange-billed feather cap. It was also tap. I remember trying to fit into that costume as a seven or eight year old and breaking the blue sequin strap that I yanked onto my shoulder in hopes it would stretch the leotard out a bit. 

In high school, my interest in dancing waned slightly but I continued taking regular dance classes. By college, the only dancing I was doing was at a punk show or 80's night. Then I moved to Austin.


### Lindy Hop

I can attribute my introduction to Swing Dance partly to my ambition to meet people in a new city and partly to Groupon. I had never danced with a partner before, so I thought it would be a wonderful opportunity to challenge myself. I signed up for my first (discount-priced) month of Lindy Hop lessons through an organization called The Lindy Project in October 2011.

Lindy Hop is a form of swing dance that originated in African American communities in Harlem, New York in the 1920's and 30's. Strongly influenced by jazz,tap and Charleston, it can be danced both [solo and with a partner] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llZpUhJAKbQ&list=PL1CE48ADBEA5E491D&index=5). Interestingly, the origin of the name is said to have come from Charles Lindbergh after his solo non-stop flight from New York to Paris in 1927. The name "Lindbergh Hop" lasted briefly before it was shortened to "The Lindy". Lindy Hop's basic step is the swing out, which follows an eight-count structure. I've been told the perfect swing out is the holy grail of Lindy. I don't know if I agree with that, but it is often a focal point of some workshops. Aside from this step, there are plenty of variations one can choose from when dancing. From tuck turns to Texas Tommy, there is always a move that can be refined or modified. The Lindy Hop scene has experienced a recent revival and there are now [workshops and competitions] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GTrNLauLrs) offered internationally. I've attended these in Texas and in Beijing!

###Beijing has a Swing Dance Scene! 

At the end of 2014, it was time to start thinking about where to move. The fact that Beijing has a dance scene was surprisingly influential in our decision to relocate to this city.  Gully was intent on learning, and dancing was part of my weekly routine. 

I wasn't exactly surprised when I discovered the Beijing dance scene, but I definitely underestimated it's popularity. My first experience was at a European-style bar with checkerboard floors and cocktails that have names like the "Frida Kahlo". It was a Pure Balboa class. Pure Balboa is differentiated from Lindy Hop by it's [full body connection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O65KqT0Vby8) and fairly upright posture. It is danced completely in closed position, so it's a dance ideal for small cafe's and crowded venues. It can also be danced to fast tempo music. Some of the original dancers became tired of dancing so closely, so they began to incorporate some [spins and turns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trhIm-emqvQ) into the footwork, and Bal Swing was born.

From that night, I was connected to the WeChat Balboa group and Swing Beijing group. The calendar listed at least one event for every single night of the week! Most of them were lower to mid-level lindy hop and balboa classes, but they also offered solo jazz and open practice on the weekends. 

Gully and I decided to check out Cat's Corner on Saturday night. This is a dedicated studio that hosts many of the swing dance classes. On this night, it happened to reach near freezing temperatures and Gully and I, being unfamiliar with the area and disoriented by the cold, gave up our search about 20 minutes after we left the warmth of the taxi. It was frustrating, but we gave it another try about two months later and that time had better luck. The studio is tucked away in the basement of a bank, so it's understandable why we couldn't find it the first night. 

###Practice and Building Confidence

About a month ago, Gully began a level I Lindy Hop class on Monday nights. He's now advanced to a level II class. He's making great progress! He's also watching videos online and making lists of moves he wants to learn. I attended a workshop last month with instructors from South Korea. The benefit of attending this workshop was two-fold; I learned some new moves and I also became a familiar face in the scene.

Sometimes, it's tough to put yourself out there. As a follow, it's historically expected of one to wait for a lead to ask for a dance. Well, I can say as an unknown foreigner entering this already established scene, I haven't had many offers to dance. Attending classes and workshops provides an opportunity for me to meet other dancers so that, at the next social dance, we recognize each other and feel more inclined to dance together. From there, I build my confidence to ask others to dance because, as a feminist, I take no consideration of gender roles.  

That's it, for now, on Swing Dance. Here is a playlist to get you in the dancing mood!
