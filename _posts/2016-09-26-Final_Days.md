I have two more days of living in a country I have called my home for exactly 382 days. 
I’m not gonna lie; Beijing is kind of a tough city to live in. More than once, I’ve looked up flights leaving to the US the following day; I’ve cried because cold weather, the northern latitude, and a constant blanket of pollution had a serious impact on my mood in the winter; I’ve yelled at completely avoidable traffic jams; I’ve bemoaned seemingly pointless rules and regulations.  But I’ve also been given this incredible opportunity to experience a culture that in many ways is so different from mine, with daily experiences so frustrating and so beautiful and so unexpected, that all I can do upon final reflection is laugh.  To put it into perspective, I decided to make a list of things I’ve done while living abroad:  

- traveled to 5 countries (China, Japan, South Korea, Italy, England)
- visited 2 special administrative regions (Hong Kong, Macau)
- danced Lindy Hop in 4 countries (China, Japan, Italy, England)
- took [Lindy Hop](http://chugly.github.io/Swing_dancing_in_Beijing) classes in Chinese
- started a [B-horror](http://chugly.github.io/China_horror_movies)/cult cinema group
- went rock climbing for the first time
- saw 1 [dead body](http://chugly.github.io/Dead_Body_in_the_River) floating in the river
- rode an [electric blue scooter](http://chugly.github.io/Scoot_commute) over 5,000 kilometers
- climbed the Great Wall of China, twice.
- rode a toboggan down the Great Wall of China, twice.
- worked with 3 organizations that assist in the adoption of Chinese orphans (Bethel, Amazing Hands, [Shepherd’s Field](http://chugly.github.io/Shepherds_Field)).
- provided speech therapy services to over 20 Chinese children (my Chinese language skills are comparable to those of an 18 month old) AND saw amazing progress
- received 1 temporary work license comparable to that of a doctor, in China
- trained 1 local Chinese therapist to specialize in speech therapy
- observed 1 Grand Tournament of Sumo Wrestling in Tokyo, Japan
- experienced AQI beyond index (that’s serious air pollution)
- bought and thoroughly used 21 HEPA air filters
- danced guǎngchǎng wǔ in Ditan Park with over 40 people
- climbed the 7,200 steps of Tài Shān, one of  the five great mountains of china
- visited 14 UNESCO World Heritage Sites 
- shared a living space with a partner for the first time (it was super easy and almost every night feels like a slumber party)

So, on our penultimate night in this now mostly empty apartment, I contemplate the next three months. One will be spent traveling in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand; one will be dedicated to visiting family and collecting belongings. From there, it’s less certain.  Around this time last year, I was preparing myself to live in China for one year.  Now I’m deciding whether or not to pack my Jaws towel poncho because of it’s weight. 

Later days, China.
