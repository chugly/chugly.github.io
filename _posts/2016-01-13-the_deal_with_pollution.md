In a word association game, what would you say when prompted with the word "Beijing"?  I suspect most Americans' responses would include the words "China", "Olympics", "city", and "pollution".  Pollution was among our chief concerns before moving here.  When we spoke with travellers who lived here, we would ask "What's the deal with the pollution?".  The answer depends on who you ask.  Four and a half months into our journey here, we can offer our answer to a question that we'll probably be answering for years to come.

### What's the deal with the pollution?

The deal is that sometimes it gets really polluted in Beijing.  There are two words to that statement that we will dissect.  First is the *somtimes* and second is the *really*.

### *Sometimes*

*Sometimes* means that it's not always polluted here, which is a misconception that I had, and a misconception that is probably shared among many outsiders.  When I got out of the Beijing airport and breathed the Beijing air, it reminded me of a forgettable scene from the movie *12 Monkeys*, a lesser-known early nineties Brad Pitt flick with a killer soundtrack.  The scene I have in mind is towards the end (spoiler alert), when the perpetrator of a biological terror attack opens---upon request by a customs agent---a vile of odorless, clear gas in an airport lobby.  The toxin has just silently infected him and the agent, and was now permeating the air around them.  The perp's grimmace as he quietly acknowledges the toxic air around him must have been mirrored in my own face when I surveyed the Beijing air for the first time.  *WAS IT OKAY TO BREATHE?*.  I slowly took longer and longer breaths as I became comfortable with the fact that the air was just fine.  The next morning when we woke up at our friends' place in Chaoyangmen, Beijing we saw beautiful blue skies.  What's the deal with that?

Beijing is only polluted when the air is still for a few days.  When there is no *wind*, the air stagnates, and the pollution has nowhere to go.  It just builds up.  So naturally when Beijing is *windy*, the pollution gets blown away to somewhere else (sorry rest of the world), and the air is clear.  

The change in wind direction and strength can be sudden.  Chelsey and I went

### Health risks

It has been difficult to find reliable information about the actual health risks associated with pollution.  My personal feeling has wavered on this point, and it still might.

There are two main things to consider about the air pollution in Beijing. When the pollution is at its worst, it's still less than smoking a 0.2 of a cigarette, assuming worst-case all day exposure.  Normal prevention like being inside, having air purifiers, and wearing masks gets that exposure to negligible levels.  f you're a cigarette smoker, the Beijing exposure is irrelevant.  The other main thing to consider is that the pollution is highly variable.  Most days you don't have to wear a mask or run air purifiers.  I wear a mask when the AQI reading is greater than 200, which is probably 10% of the time.  Today is beautiful clear blue skies, with AQI of 25, probably comparable to or lower than many American cities today.  I can see the distant mountains in the reflection of my bookcase towards the northwest.  But the pollution is definitely palpable when it's at its worst.  The visibility is low- like an especially foggy day.  Chelsey complains about the smell, but I don't notice it (she is a 'supertaster' apparently).  I'm usually wearing masks when it's bad enough to be able to smell it, though.  When I intentionally tried to smell it the other day by peeling off my mask and taking a couple big whiffs, it just smelled like a tinge of campfire or coal burning-- most of the pollution comes from coal factories that produce energy at low cost.

### Politics
As for the politics of it all, my buddy Chase cited a statistic that the US generates 3 times the amount of green house gas emissions as China *per capita*.  Well, when you divide by a big number, you usually get a small number, and not all energy is created equal.  So I have less informed things to say on the politics.  But the palpable pollution definitely makes me internalize my own contribution to pollution.  The PM2.5 measurement of 500 is what it took the factories to produce enough energy and goods to provide the services that I consume every day.  That PM 2.5 is just usually blown away to "somewhere else", like the upper atmosphere.  But there is no "somewhere else" in the atmosphere.  When the wind is still, that stuff just hangs around for a while, so you can notice it.  

The other thing I think about a lot in regards to the pollution is that China happens to be going through its industrial revolution and Gilded Age now instead of the 1880s.  Americans' collective tolerance for pollution has gone down as our wealth and access to technology has increased.  China doesn't have that luxury yet.  But they will.
