Before we moved here, a big question for us was "What's the deal with the pollution?".  In a word association game,

### Health risks

It has been difficult to find reliable information about the actual health risks associated with pollution.  My personal feeling has wavered on this point, and it still might.

There are two main things to consider about the air pollution in Beijing. When the pollution is at its worst, it's still less than smoking a 0.2 of a cigarette, assuming worst-case all day exposure.  Normal prevention like being inside, having air purifiers, and wearing masks gets that exposure to negligible levels.  f you're a cigarette smoker, the Beijing exposure is irrelevant.  The other main thing to consider is that the pollution is highly variable.  Most days you don't have to wear a mask or run air purifiers.  I wear a mask when the AQI reading is greater than 200, which is probably 10% of the time.  Today is beautiful clear blue skies, with AQI of 25, probably comparable to or lower than many American cities today.  I can see the distant mountains in the reflection of my bookcase towards the northwest.  But the pollution is definitely palpable when it's at its worst.  The visibility is low- like an especially foggy day.  Chelsey complains about the smell, but I don't notice it (she is a 'supertaster' apparently).  I'm usually wearing masks when it's bad enough to be able to smell it, though.  When I intentionally tried to smell it the other day by peeling off my mask and taking a couple big whiffs, it just smelled like a tinge of campfire or coal burning-- most of the pollution comes from coal factories that produce energy at low cost.

### Politics
As for the politics of it all, my buddy Chase cited a statistic that the US generates 3 times the amount of green house gas emissions as China *per capita*.  Well, when you divide by a big number, you usually get a small number, and not all energy is created equal.  So I have less informed things to say on the politics.  But the palpable pollution definitely makes me internalize my own contribution to pollution.  The PM2.5 measurement of 500 is what it took the factories to produce enough energy and goods to provide the services that I consume every day.  That PM 2.5 is just usually blown away to "somewhere else", like the upper atmosphere.  But there is no "somewhere else" in the atmosphere.  When the wind is still, that stuff just hangs around for a while, so you can notice it.  

The other thing I think about a lot in regards to the pollution is that China happens to be going through its industrial revolution and Gilded Age now instead of the 1880s.  Americans' collective tolerance for pollution has gone down as our wealth and access to technology has increased.  China doesn't have that luxury yet.  But they will.
