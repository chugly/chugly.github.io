What do I miss about living in Austin and the United States?    
How do I feel about my scooter?  
How often do I mention milkshakes?       


##I REALLY MISS…

**September 2015** Ward 
>“If I were to choose the two things I miss most about Austin, other than friends, it would be tacos and the Alamo Ritz.”

**November 2015** Ward 
>“How's Austin? Any changes? I really miss the Alamo Drafthouse and drinking milkshakes. We've been getting decent at making breakfast tacos at home. We're just missing the salsa.” 

**November 25, 2015** Fishy
>“I really miss petting animals.”

**January 9, 2016** Dida 
>“I miss you too, Dida! It's so COLD in Beijing right now. I’ve never experienced anything like it.”

**February 29, 2016** Katie
>“It was good talking to you yesterday. I miss our random chats with you or me driving to work.”

**March 2016** Carolyn 
>“Have you visited the Farmer's Market in downtown Austin yet? It's on Saturdays and it's one of the things I miss most!”

**March 2016** Ward 
>“Man, I miss those milkshakes.”

**April 2016** Carolyn 
>“I love the wolf-man! I really miss having easy access to old movies.”

**May 2016** Becca 
>“I really miss cycling. I can't wait to get back on my bike.”

**May 18, 2016** Gully 
>“Tonight on my way home, I was thinking that I'll miss the chaos of the hutongs.”

**June 2016** Carolyn 
>“I really miss my nieces and nephew.”

**June 2016** Alese 
>“Something I really miss while living in Beijing is activism.”

**June 13, 2016** Crystal 
>“There is very little law enforcement on the road, so it's kind of a free for all. There's something about the craziness of it that I'm actually going to miss a little bit.”

**June 14, 2016** Carolyn 
>“ I really miss you all.”

**June 19, 2016** Amanda 
>“I really miss being crafty.”  


##SCOOTER

**September 27, 2015** Dida 
>“I’m meeting a woman today to check out an electric scooter in hopes it will make my commute faster and more comfortable.”

**October 2015** Ward 
>“Also, did I mention I bought a scooter? I don't think I did. It's electric blue and I'm like Mad Max on that thing.”

**November 2015** Daddy 
>“I bought a scooter to reduce my commute time to work.”

**November 25, 2015** Fishy 
>“When someone cuts me off on my scooter, I shout curses at them and flick them off but then I look around and everyone else is unfazed.”

**November 25, 2015** Fishy 
>“Oh my god, there are so many modes of transportation. I will name them: walking, cycling, scooter (motor bike, small scooter, large scooter), motorcycle, tuk-tuk (tiny cart that is encased by plastic and carries three people at most, including driver- these people give the least fucks of all drivers in this city), electric vehicle that has a cart on the back where people transport large items, car, bus, taxi subway, air wheel, skateboard.”

**January 9, 2016** Dida
>“One day this week, I decided to ride my scooter to work and had to wear a pair of Gully's pants over my pants, as well as one of his sweatshirts under my coat. I was still cold!”

**January, 2016** Ward 
>“It's cold as fuck in Beijing. Currently, the temperature is 25 degrees with 30% humidity. It was officially too cold to ride my scooter today.”
