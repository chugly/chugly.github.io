Beijing is a huge city with tons of neighborhoods, circuitous interconnecting streets, and more to do than one could reasonably expect to accomplish in a lifetime.  I often remind myself of just-how-big Beijing is when Chelsey and I  passby something amazing and lament that we hadn't already discovered it yet.  There is just so much stuff here.  In this post we will break down some of our favorite discoveries so far.  We will most likely share some, or most of these experiences with you because we think they're the best.  But we will also explore new things.  In fact we have not visited some of the city's most popular destinations, anticipating that we will experience them for the first time alongside our visitors.
