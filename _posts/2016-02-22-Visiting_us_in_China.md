Beijing is a huge city with tons of neighborhoods, circuitous interconnecting streets, and more to do than one could reasonably expect to accomplish in a lifetime.  I often remind myself of just-how-big Beijing is when Chelsey and I  pass by something amazing and lament that we hadn't already discovered it yet.  There is just so much stuff here.  In this post we will break down some of our favorite discoveries so far.  We will most likely share some, or most of these experiences with you if you visit because we think they're the best.  But we will also explore new things.  In fact we have not visited some of the city's most popular destinations, anticipating that we will experience them for the first time alongside our visitors.  

### Dining out

One of the best things about Beijing is the diversity and quality of cuisine.  We will probably have a whole post on Dining Out at some point, but for now we will list some highlights to give you a metaphorical taste of what's in your future if you come through China's Capital.  I suppose most Westerners don't come to Beijing to have Western style food.  But if you're here long enough a visit to Taco Bar or NOLA may convince you that we're getting by just fine on the Taco and grits front.

### Dining in
If it's been a long day exploring and you just want to stay home and enjoy a home cooked meal, you are in luck.  Chelsey and I maintain a limited but solid menu.  It's even better with a choice of one of our red wines.

### The great wall of China

One of the most obvious destinations in China is the Great Wall.  You might be surprised to know that it's only a 1 hour car ride from Beijing.  With the iconic Wall at your finger tips, you would be a fool to skip this Wonder of the World.  So that means that you have to find transportation.  Though it seems like there are public transport options, our impression is that hiring a personal driver is superior in terms of speed, comfort, and flexibility.  The drivers offer rides to the Great Wall for about RMB 500 / day, which generally includes multiple destinations if desired.  Chelsey and I can recommend a driver who might be the fastest in all Beijing.  When you let go of fearing for your life, the experience is kind of exciting.  And besides you'll get there before everyone else.

There are several different portions of the Great Wall that are within driving distance to Beijing.  Chelsey and some of our friends from Austin had the opportunity to visit the *Mutianyu* section in December.  We had a terrific time, and would recommend this section to anyone.  There's just something deeply surreal about going to the Great Wall of China.  Besides the existentialism, there are some other cool features that make Mutianyu stick out.  You take a chair lift to the wall, and you have the option to take a wheeled toboggan ride down the mountain back to the base.  [We had so much fun on the toboggan ride](https://www.instagram.com/p/_MiulIB_i8/?taken-by=xgully), which was a fun coda to the breathtaking views and awe-insprining reflection on the passage of time that the Wall imbues.  

When faced with future opportunity to visit the Wall I would be happy to go back to Mutianyu, or try another section.  In Mutianyu you start and stop in the same place- the chair lift and toboggan are next to each other.  In other sections it is possible to arrange a drop off and pick up in different places so you hike for about 6 hours, if that suits you.  


### East of our neighborhood: Confucius Temple, Lama Temple

Historically significant temples and modern night life destinations sandwich our neighborhood, the Wudaoying Hutong.  Walking around our neighborhood would be a great first day activity.  As the jetlag wears off you can make your way to the Confucius Temple.  This 700 year old site is a stone's throw from our patio.  The self guided tour through the temple includes beautiful statues, temples halls, historic academic buildings, and regular dancing performances.  

If you keep walking east on Guozijian Street for a block, you encounter the Yonghegong Lama Temple.  I have not seen this famous temple yet, but I walk by it all the time.  I'm overdue for a visit.


### West of our neighborhood: Gulou, Luogu Houhai, Shichahai

To our West lie some of the most popular shopping and tourist destinations.  These are walking distance.
