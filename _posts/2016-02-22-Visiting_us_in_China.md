Beijing is a huge city with tons of neighborhoods, circuitous interconnecting streets, and more to do than one could reasonably expect to accomplish in a lifetime.  I often remind myself of just-how-big Beijing is when Chelsey and I  pass by something amazing and lament that we hadn't already discovered it yet.  There is just so much stuff here.  In this post we will break down some of our favorite discoveries so far.  We will most likely share some, or most of these experiences with you if you visit because we think they're the best.  But we will also explore new things.  In fact we have not visited some of the city's most popular destinations, anticipating that we will experience them for the first time alongside our visitors.  

### Dining out

One of the best things about Beijing is the diversity and quality of cuisine.  Or simply put, the food here rules.  We will probably have a whole post on Dining Out at some point, but for now we will list some highlights to give you a metaphorical taste of what's in your future if you come through China's Capital.  I suppose most Westerners don't come to Beijing to have Western style food.  But if you're here long enough a visit to Taco Bar or NOLA may convince you that we're getting by just fine on the Taco and Etouffe front.

### Dining in
If it's been a long day exploring and you just want to stay home and enjoy a home cooked meal, you are in luck.  Chelsey and I maintain a limited but solid menu.  It's even better with a choice of one of our red wines.
