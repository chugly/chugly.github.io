Chelsey and I went to TEDxBeijing today.  It was fun!  There were eight speakers covering topics of reproductive health, economics, artificial intelligence, linguistics, art, preservation, technology, and business.  

### We like TED talks

Like millions of people, Chelsey and I have watched some of the hundreds of videos on the TED website, with curated, rehearsed talks spanning diverse ideas.  The "ideas worth spreading" touch almost every corner of modern technology, society, and humanities one could imagine.  It's hard to find a topic that isn't covered.  Chelsey and I think TED videos are usually *awesome*.  Though our viewership has sporadic episodes, we often quip at how informative or inspiring they are.  We recently binge-watched many talks about marine science and art.  So we were jazzed when we caught sight of of a [Beijinger](http://www.thebeijinger.com) article announcing that an independently organized TEDxBeijing would be held in January.  We reserved tickets.  

We could not find the complete lineup of speakers before the event, but we were convinced the talks would meet the high bar we have come to expect from perusing the TED archive.  The one question was-- "What language would the talks be in? Would there be translators?"  We wagered that there would be some translation system.  Chelsey was stoked when she found out there would be microphone headsets (a la United Nations).  Her long-time dream job was to be a UN translator.

### Sichahai Theatre
We scooted over to the nearby Sichahai Theatre on this freezing cold Sunday afternoon.  The adjacent Hou-Hai lake was peppered with ice skaters, and children on bicycle-like lounge contraptions.  Never seen those before.  We made our way to the theater to find a long line of attendees.  We joined them, shifting our positions to accomodate the usual scene of cars driving through an alley the size of a car.

We collected our U.N.-style headset and got our seats.  We admired the beautiful the Sichahai Theatre, which hosts the slew of dance and music performances.  The stage had the characterisitic red circle for the speaker, and the three dimensional TEDx logo on the left side of the stage.  After a short (and bungled) introduction, the talks began.  We listened to eight talks separated in the middle by a short break.  

### TEDxBeijing

**Speaker 1**  The first speaker was a Chinese-born investor and CEO who has started a shoe factory in Ethiopia.  The main idea is that China will eventually transition away from a manufacturing economy as its middle class grows.  The speaker highlighted other nearby economies that have made these transitions: Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and others.  But China's size means that this transition will cause ripples around the world.  Where will these jobs go?  The speaker argued for the increasing role of places like Ethiopia, which approached investors like her to bring manufacturing floors to Africa.  The speaker extolled the merits--and noted some challenges--of doing business in Ethiopia so far.  She ended on a hopeful and personal story showing that she is convinced Ethiopia will go through a phase of economic growth similar to that of China.

**Speaker 2** This talk was a little bit more meta or squishy, so my recap might be muddled.  The speaker identified himself primarily as an artist, and secondarily as a "Social Sensibility R&D manager."  The justification for the latter title was the topic of the rest of the talk.  He explained his role at a Chinese manufacturing company, where he
