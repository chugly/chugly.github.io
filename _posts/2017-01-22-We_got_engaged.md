We're back in the U.S.A., y'all! The big news to come from our travels around Southeast Asia is that Gully popped the question and now we're engaged! We bought a car, drove from Boston to California via Miami, seeing so many great friends and family along the way.  We've finally arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area. We're in the process of making a wedding website--Stay tuned!

The underwater photo above is from one of our scuba diving adventures at a shipwreck near Amed, Indonesia.  We observed manta rays, giant sea turtles, mantis shrimps, eels, and multiple shipwrecks.  We even went night-diving!  We got engaged on a black sand beach about 8 hours after this photo was taken.
