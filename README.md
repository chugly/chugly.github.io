# Chelsey and Gully's website

This is the source code for Chelsey and Gully's website.  We are using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the [Jekyll Modern Blog](https://github.com/inded/Jekyll_modern-blog) theme ( original [demo](http://inded.github.io/Jekyll_modern-blog/) here), Created by Claudio Calautti for Codrops.  The theme is originally based off of this [article from Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/?p=24222).

Since the theme is [GNU GPL license v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), I think that means this repo must also be GPL.  So yeah, GPL.
